This repository contains the requisite files for a [shiny app](https://shiny.rstudio.com/py/) which ranks the involvement of genes in a multiphenotypic syndrome based on several gene features, the most novel of which being the frequency of somatic mutations in this gene across all cancers. 

Shiny apps can be run in the [terminal](https://shiny.rstudio.com/py/docs/get-started.html). 

To use, simply enter a list of genes, select the phenotypes which characterize your syndrome (either individually or by selecting a canonical [OMIM](https://omim.org) disease)
